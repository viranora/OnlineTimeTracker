# ✨ Online Time Tracker (Flutter Draft)

Hello there! I wanted to design a clean and simple mobile planner to help keep track of tasks.

This is the first draft of the UI, built with Flutter. It's all about making time tracking feel a bit more organized, colorful, and friendly. It's just a frontend concept for now, but I loved working with Dart and Flutter widgets!
